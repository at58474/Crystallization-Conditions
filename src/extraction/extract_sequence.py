class PDBPreprocessingSequences:
    """
    This class handles preprocessing of PDB files to extract FASTA sequences.

    Notes:
        - The main task is to parse the SEQRES records in .pdb files and extract
          the protein sequences.
        - These sequences are then saved in FASTA format (.fasta files).
        - Multiprocessing is used to speed up processing when handling large numbers
          of files (hundreds of thousands).
        - The number of worker processes and chunksize can be configured to tune
          performance for different hardware setups (e.g. SSD vs HDD).

    Example:
        seq_extractor = PDBPreprocessingSequences("Data/PDB_Files", "Data/Protein_Sequences/SEQRES")
        seq_extractor.handle_multiprocessing()
